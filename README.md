# Tweet-Generator-Program
This program generates tweets by randomly selecting a word from a text file and finding other words related to it. Some text files are already provided. feel free to add more.
The algorithm can also be applied to any text file other than tweets to generate some fairly meaningful paragraphs. The larger the word window width, the more understandable the sentences generated are.
